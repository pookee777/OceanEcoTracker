Manual Input Functionality
This dashboard allows users to manually adjust all key sensor values through number input fields or sliders. Every time the user changes a value, the display updates in real time, and charts reflect the new data point. This gives users full control over the simulation without relying on automatic or random data changes.

1. 🌊 Water Quality Panel (Manual Inputs)
Users can manually enter water pH and turbidity values to observe how water quality changes over time.

Input fields allow users to enter pH (0–14) and turbidity (in NTU).

The updated values are shown live on the screen.

Charts automatically log and visualize the pH and turbidity over time.

2. 🌿 CO₂ Level & Algae Capture Panel (Manual Inputs)
This panel lets users input CO₂ levels and instantly see how much CO₂ algae might capture based on that level.

Users enter CO₂ concentration (ppm) via a number input.

Algae CO₂ capture is automatically calculated using a fixed formula (e.g., capture = (co2 / 1000) * 80g).

A real-time chart logs CO₂ values and shows the trend over time.

3. 🔄 Plastic-to-Fuel Conversion Panel (Manual Inputs)
This section helps simulate how much fuel is produced based on plastic collected.

A number input lets users enter grams of plastic.

The system automatically converts this to fuel using a formula (e.g., 1g plastic = 0.8mL fuel).

Results are shown instantly on the dashboard and plotted in a fuel generation chart.

4. 📊 Dynamic Chart Updates (Chart.js)
Each change made through the input fields is logged in a graph using Chart.js, helping visualize the impact of different variables over time.

pH, turbidity, CO₂, and fuel generation each have their own time-series chart.

Charts update as soon as values change, giving a live, interactive feel.

5. 🧠 Plastic Detection with TensorFlow.js (Optional)
If the Teachable Machine model is loaded, the dashboard can detect plastic objects using your webcam.

Webcam input is processed by the TensorFlow.js model.

Detected plastic can optionally auto-increment the “Plastic Collected” value.

The detection result and confidence score are displayed on the screen.
